                This Acceptance criteria has been met in Unit Test Screenshots.
                The Screenshots show the Unit Tests checking that the players starting deck

                This Acceptance criteria has been met in the System Test Screenshots.
                The first screenshot shows Deck size of 12 and no cards drawn yet.
